# Getting Started
If the packages from the repository 
[`ethz-asl/eth_robotics_summer_school_2019`](https://github.com/ethz-asl/eth_robotics_summer_school_2019) have already been downloaded and 
built, it is possible to skip the "Installation" section and go directly to the
["Structure of the code"](#structure-of-the-code).  
If this is not the case, follow the installation instructions below.
## Installation
This package is intended to be used with Ubuntu 18.04 and [ROS melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) or above.
After installing ROS, install some extra dependencies:
```asm
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-cmake-modules ros-melodic-ompl ros-melodic-costmap-2d ros-melodic-grid-map ros-melodic-grid-map-visualization ros-melodic-navfn ros-melodic-velodyne-gazebo-plugins python-wstool python-catkin-tools libyaml-cpp-dev protobuf-compiler autoconf
```
Then if not already done so, set up a new catkin workspace:
```asm
$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin init
$ catkin config --extend /opt/ros/melodic
$ catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ catkin config --merge-devel
```
In this installation guide, it is assumed that the following packages for 
simulation have already been downloaded and built in the same catkin workspace:
* `any_node`
* `message_logger`
* `smb_sim`
* `smb_path_following_controller`
* `elevation_mapping`
* `elevation_mapping_demo`
* `traversability_estimation`

To download all the other necessary dependencies for the path planner, run 
the following script in the source folder of your catkin workspace, by 
specifying the destination `src_workspace_path` of the clone procedure:
```asm
$ chmod +x smb_path_planner/bin/clone_repos.sh
$ ./smb_path_planner/bin/clone_repos.sh -f src_workspace_path
```
To show the help of the installation script, make it executable and run:
```asm
$ ./smb_path_planner/bin/clone_repos.sh -h
```
Then, compile:
```asm
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin build smb_path_planner
```
## Structure of the code
The `smb_path_planner` package is composed by 4 parts:
* `smb_planner_common`: this package implements all the utility functions for 
visualization, parameter reading and traversability estimation that are 
needed by both the global and the local planners.
* `smb_planner_rviz`: this package is the implementation for the planning 
panel in RViz.
* `smb_global_planner`: global planner package. It is possible to select 
different planning algorithms (RRT*, Informed RRT*, PRM) by modifying the 
parameter file `smb_planner_parameters.yaml`.
* `smb_local_planner`: local planner package. It implements the CHOMP solver 
with nonholonomic constraints.  

The parameters for the planners and the elevation and traversability mapping 
are stored in `smb_path_planner/smb_planner_common/cfg/`.

## Planning Panel in RViz
Make sure all the packages have built successfully. As a sanity check, 
re-source your workspace (`$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`) and start 
up RViz (`$ rviz`).
In RViz, select `Panels -> Add New Panel` and select `Planning Panel` under 
`smb_planner_rviz`.

Next, under `Displays`, add an `InteractiveMarkers` display with the topic 
`/planning_markers/update`. You should be able to see the interactive markers
 and the planning panel.

## How to run the planner in simulation
First, start the simulation in Gazebo, RViz and RQT Plugin to select the 
controller, by running:
```asm
$ roslaunch smb_sim sim_path_planner.launch
```
In the controller panel, select `SmbPathFollowingController` from 
the list. If this controller does not show up, press the refresh button and 
try again. To start the controller, press the play button.  
Then, start the `elevation_mapping` node:
```asm
$ roslaunch smb_local_planner smb_elevation_mapping_simulation.launch
``` 
Finally, start the local and global planners:
```asm
$ roslaunch smb_local_planner smb_planner_simulation.launch
```
To send a global goal position, select it in the planning panel and press the
button `Global Planner Service`. Once a global path has been computed and 
showed in RViz, start the local planner by pressing the button `Start Local 
Planner`.  

## How to run the planner on the real robot
Start the `LPC` on the robot and the `OPC` on the operator side. To run the 
`LPC`, run the following commands in the PC of the robot in multiple terminals:
```asm
$ roscore # terminal 1
$ roslaunch smb_lpc lpc.launch # terminal 2
```
Start the LiDAR and the mapping in another terminal in the robot PC:
```asm
$ roslaunch ethzasl_icp_mapper supermegabot_robosense_dynamic_mapper.launch # terminal 3
``` 
 Then to start the planners, run on the PC of the robot in separate terminals:
```asm
$ roslaunch smb_local_planner smb_elevation_mapping_real.launch # terminal 4
$ roslaunch smb_local_planner smb_planner_real.launch # terminal 5
```
On the operator side, start the `OPC`. First connect the `rosmaster` of the 
PC to the `rosmaster` of the robot and then run in a terminal:
```asm
$ roslaunch smb_opc opc.launch
```
To send a global goal position, follow the same procedure as in simulation:
1. Select the `SmbPathFollowingController` in the control panel and start it;
2. Send the global goal using the `Planning Panel` in RViz.
